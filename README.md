# ML Mini Projects

This repository contains two beginner-to-intermediate level **Machine Learning projects** implemented in Jupyter Notebooks:

1. **Cancer Prediction** â€“ A classification model to predict whether a tumor is benign or malignant.
2. **Movie Recommendation** â€“ A recommender system that suggests movies based on similarity.

ðŸ“’ Notebooks Overview
ðŸ”¬ 1. Cancer Prediction

Goal: Predict whether a tumor is benign or malignant.

Dataset: Breast Cancer dataset from sklearn.datasets.

Steps:

Data preprocessing & visualization

Model training (Logistic Regression, SVM, Random Forest, etc.)

Performance evaluation (accuracy, confusion matrix, classification report)

âœ… Result: A trained model with accuracy above 90%.

ðŸŽ¬ 2. Movie Recommendation

Goal: Recommend movies to users based on similarity of preferences.

Dataset: MovieLens (or similar).

Steps:

Data preprocessing & exploration

Content-based filtering using cosine similarity

Recommend top-N movies for a given input movie

âœ… Result: Personalized movie recommendations.
